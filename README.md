# Site-Reliability-Cloud-Learning

Welcome! The goal and intent of this page is to practice and continue learning how I can succeed as a Site Reliability Engineer. Throughout this process, I will try to cover and also learn along the way of what are the responsibilities of SRE's. I've always believed in learning by 'doing' so I will try to execute everything I've learned and hopefully digest complex information for my audience. Feel free to click through any sections you're interested in and I explore things that I'm learning!
