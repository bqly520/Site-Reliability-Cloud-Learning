# Using recursion, to traverse a directory until I can find files which contains a specific keyword and returns~
# Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. 
# It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach.
# So letâ€™s go back to the factorial call stack image from above. Every time we add a new call to the stack, 
# we are increasing the amount of memory that we are using. If we are analyzing the algorithm using Big O notation, 
# then we might note that this increases our SPACE complexity.
