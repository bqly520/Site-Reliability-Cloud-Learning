# Python

Here are some things I've learned throughout using Python that I've found useful for me to document so I can refer back to it later.

### Strings


### Lists

- `l.reverse()`: Reverses a list of objects in-place and does not return a copy of the list. An in-place method modifies data structures or objects outside of its own stack frame.
- `len(l)` : Gets the length of the list


### Dunder Methods
Dunder == *double underscore*
- `__str__(self)`: return string representation of object
