### TCP vs UDP

**TCP**: *Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)* is a connection-oriented protocol that computers use to communicate over the internet. It is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. For example:
>*Secure Shell (SSH)* or *File Transfer Protocol (FTP, picture messaging)* are examples of services that use TCP protocol because TCP **guarantees** delivery of data and that packets will be delivered in the order they were sent.

**UDP**: *User Datagram Protocol (UDP)* is a connectionless protocol that works just like TCP but assumes that error-checking and recovery services are not required.Â Instead, UDP continuously sends datagrams to the recipient whether they receive them or not.
>*Streaming videos* or *Online games* are best suited for UDP protocol because these applications or services requires speed and efficiency.
